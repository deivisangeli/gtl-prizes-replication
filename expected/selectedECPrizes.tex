\noindent \footnotesize \textit{Note}: This table lists the 68 most prestigious early career prizes. We construct prize Tiers by calculating a prestige index that puts 80\% weight on daily page views and 20\% on prize age. Tier 1 contains the top 10 prizes, Tier 2 the next 20. Within Tiers, prizes are listed alphabetically.
