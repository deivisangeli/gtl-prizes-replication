\noindent \justify \footnotesize \textit{Note}: This table provides summary statistics for the 99 recognition prizes that our methodology identifies as ``most prestigious.'' Survey Rating stands for the expert ratings of prize importance in relation to the Nobel by \cite{zheng2015mapping, jiang2018hierarchical}. Daily Page views refers to Wikipedia page views. Prize Age is with reference to the year the prize was first given. Period refers to the periodicity of the prize (e.g., yearly = 1, given once every two years = 2, and so on). Money values are in thousands of USD.
