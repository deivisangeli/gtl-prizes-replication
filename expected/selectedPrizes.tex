\noindent \footnotesize \textit{Note}: This table lists the 99 prizes that our methodology has identified as ``most prestigious,'' ranked. Prizes are sorted by Rating, which is the sum of the prestige indicators weighted by the first principal component loadings. Prizes with the same Rating up to the first decimal are shown under the same Rank. Tiers are defined according to the cumulative sum of the yearly most prestigious recognition events (1 event = 1 personbeing recognized with 1 prize): Tier 1 includes the top 10\% recognition events, Tier 2 the next 20\%, and Tier 3 the remaining.
